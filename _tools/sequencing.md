We are leaders in evolve and resequence studies and prioritize speed of inquiry. We either use our own Illumina NextSeq550 for large sample sets or send samples to preferred providers that we advise. Since 2015, we have sequenced >20,000 bacterial clones and populations. A favorite phrase in our laboratory is “sequencing is cheap, analysis is expensive”, and it is in this analysis where we thrive. Whole population genome sequencing allows us to study dynamics of evolving populations.. When we combine this with single-cell barcoding, a technique we have developed, we will achieve fine-scale resolution of the demography and dynamics of populations over even smaller time scales and survey greater diversity.
