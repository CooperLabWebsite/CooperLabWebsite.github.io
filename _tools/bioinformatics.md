We develop bioinformatic tools and tutorials to better analyze, visualize, and draw conclusions from big data generated when sequencing evolving populations. For instance, [Lolipop](https://github.com/cdeitrick/Lolipop) is a tool developed to infer genotype linkage and to visualize allele frequency dynamics of a population over time. We also have developed many scripts that streamline the analysis of whole genome sequencing data.
