Experimental evolution is a powerful approach to study all aspects of the evolutionary process under controlled conditions.  which allows for real-time observations of changing phenotypes and genotypes. Microbial experimental evolution is an ideal system because microbes have fast generation times, are easy to archive, and can be propagated with high-throughput techniques. Findings are largely applicable to understanding evolutionary processes that drive population diversity and adaptation across the tree of life.
