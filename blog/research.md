As a lab we seek to answer the following questions:

1. [Can we predict microbial evolution during host association or towards drug resistance?](/research/host_adaption.html)

2. [How do bacteria evolve and form communities within biofilms? What does this teach us about nascent multicellularity?](/research/biofilms.html)

3. [How and why do ecological tradeoffs evolve?](/research/ecological_tradeoffs.html)

4. [Why do genome regions replicated at different times evolve at different rates?](/research/genome_evolution.html)

5. [Evolution is best taught by hands-on experimentation. How do we deliver this on a massive scale?](/research/evolving_stem.html)
