I am an evolutionary geneticist and microbiologist whose lab applies genomic technology to understand ecological and evolutionary dynamics in microbial populations. We have pioneered methods for studying long-term evolution in biofilm populations and for measuring genome-wide mutation rates. Our focus is pathogen evolution that occurs during chronic infections, but we also study eco-evolutionary dynamics in biofilms, the ecological context of antimicrobial resistance, why genome regions mutate/evolve at different rates, and how the microbiome itself evolves with various conditions. As a teacher, I advocate for the study of evolution-in-action using hands-on experiments, which we’ve developed into a simple yet powerful curriculum for 9th-10th graders. This curriculum, called EvolvingSTEM, produces significant increases in learning of evolution and heredity, and also increases motivation towards pursuing STEM-related careers.

My wife Erika and I enjoy spending time with our two boys and two Cardigan Welsh corgis. You’ll find often us at a swim meet, baseball diamond, soccer pitch, or when we’re lucky, fishing or vacationing at the beach or in the mountains. I still love swimming, cycling, and running (even if my knees don’t) and raced triathlon for 25 years, including 20 Ironman finishes (7 in Kona).
