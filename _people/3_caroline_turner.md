Dr. Turner uses experimental evolution to study ecological and evolutionary processes, particularly focusing on the diversification of a single ancestral genotype into multiple ecologically distinct clades. She completed her Ph.D. with Dr. Richard Lenski at Michigan State University, working with the Long-Term Evolution Experiment with E. coli. She studied the ecological interactions between citrate-consuming and non-citrate consuming clades which evolved and coexisted within one population of the long-term experiment. She also studied the evolution of elemental composition in bacteria under carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions. As a NASA Post-doctoral Fellow in the Cooper Lab, Caroline studies the diversification of Burkholderia cenocepacia under selection for biofilm formation and genetic patterns of adaptation to varying environments.
