# As a lab we seek to answer the following questions:

#### 1. [Can we predict microbial evolution during host association or towards drug resistance?](#Host adaptation and the evolution of antimicrobial resistance)

#### 2. [How do bacteria evolve and form communities within biofilms? What does this teach us about nascent multicellularity?](#Biofilms and the origins of multicellularity)

#### 3. [How and why do ecological tradeoffs evolve?](#Ecological Tradeoffs)

#### 4. [Why do genome regions replicated at different times evolve at different rates?](#Why genome regions evolve at different rates)

#### 5. [Evolution is best taught by hands-on experimentation. How do we deliver this on a massive scale?](#EvolvingSTEM)
