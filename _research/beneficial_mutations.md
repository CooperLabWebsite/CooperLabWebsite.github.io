For years, researchers like us have used microbes as model systems to understand how evolutionary processes work. Increasingly, we can also use evolution to understand how microbes work, as a potent genetic screen for mutations that increase fitness in any imaginable environment. These mutations affect genes and systems that often yield the best adaptations and usually teach us new, surprising, fundamental attributes of microbial biology. For example, we discovered that nonsynonymous mutations in the essential tRNA-modifying gene tilS that nearly eliminate its primary function somehow increase fitness in certain environments, pointing toward a new secondary function. We’ve also identified [novel mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00932-20https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00932-20) and [new regulatory functions of enzymes involved in cyclic-di-GMP turnover](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2008540117) that enable functional diversity in biofilms. More recently we’ve collaborated with colleagues who have developed animal models for experimental evolution, which has led us to discover how [certain beneficial mutations produce adaptations](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mSystems.00352-20) to the host environment. We continue to investigate why mutations in certain genes are repeatedly selected in evolution experiments or chronic infections and how they work. This work is supported by grants from NSF and NIH.
