The Cooper Lab would like to extend a thank you to Elaine Vitone who wrote a feature, [Untangling Darwin](https://www.pittmed.health.pitt.edu/story/untangling-darwin), focused on the lab’s research in the University of Pittsburgh’s PITTMED magazine. Vitone’s feature can be accessed on PITTMED’s webpage or as a PDF.
