Jeffrey is an undergraduate researcher who is currently a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, where he is majoring in Biological Sciences. Interested in evolutionary genomics and antibiotic resistance, he is currently researching the evolution of resistance to WLBU-2, a novel cationic peptide, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations. By combining experimental evolution and population sequencing, he hopes to learn more about mechanisms of resistance to WLBU-2 and other cationic peptides. After graduation Jeffrey plans on entering a Genomics PhD program and continuing a career in research.
