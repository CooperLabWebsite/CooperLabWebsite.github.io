Aurora Sharrard, the University of Pittsburgh's director of sustainability, quoted EvolvingSTEM as part of the University's plan for balancing environmental sustainability during an interview with [*The Confluence*](https://www.wesa.fm/post/alliances-still-key-aurora-sharrards-vision-systemic-sustainability),  a daily news show in the Pittsburgh area.


>And Evolving STEM is a program that uses science and lab experiments to give students a hands-on experience with evolution. As schools across three states – including Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy, a magnet school in Pittsburgh – adopt this approach, educators are asking how teaching evolution should change. Hear from a group involved with the program:

>Vaughn Cooper, evolutionary biologist and director of the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Evolutionary Biology and Medicine, and founder of the Evolving STEM Program;
Edwina Kinchington, teacher at Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy;
Mia Perez, junior at Pittsburgh Sci-Tech; and
Sachin Thiagarajan, junior at Pittsburgh Sci-Tech.
